# Reading List
A list of books that I am currently reading and a history of what I read in the (very recent) past. All the materials listed here molded me (to various degrees) into who I am today.  
When I say "book", I mean an actual book, but also an article, a video (even an entire series), a podcast, etc. Therefore it should be considered a "watch list" as well.    
  
Sorting is done by author's name, in alphabetical order.  
I may also add other sub-categories later on.

If you want to recommend any material that you find useful, please do so via pull request.  

#### How I read the books
##### PDF:  
- usually default PDF viewer (Evince, Okular, Adobe Reader, etc.)  
##### EPUB:  
- macOS: iBooks; 
- Win: Vivlio;
- Linux: Vivlio;  
A note on digital book readers: For Windows and Linux, I haven't yet found an reader that can match iBooks design. There are readers out there, but I'm looking for a minimalist design (I'm not looking at you, Calibre), while retaining the functionality and aesthetics, while not being cluttered with useless commercials (such as many from Windows 10 Store are). In this regard, [Vivlio](https://www.vivlio.com/en/home/) is the closest I could find.

### Currently Reading / Watching
I usually read several books at any give time, partly because switching between them gives me a better perspective on the books. If you have reading advice, I am interested in hearing it.
